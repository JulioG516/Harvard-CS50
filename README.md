# CS50 Course by Harvard University
This repository contains my submissions for the CS50 course offered by Harvard University. CS50 is an introductory course in computer science that covers a wide range of topics, including algorithms, data structures, computer architecture, programming languages, software development, and more.

# Course Overview
The CS50 course is designed to be accessible to beginners and provides a solid foundation for further study in computer science. The course is structured around a series of lectures, problem sets, and projects. The lectures cover the theoretical concepts and practical applications of computer science, while the problem sets and projects allow students to apply what they have learned in practice.

# Submissions
# This repository contains my submissions for the CS50 course. Here is a brief overview of the submissions:

# pset1 - Cash and Credit
### Cash
a program that calculates the minimum number of coins required to give a user change. The program prompts the user for the amount of change owed and then calculates the minimum number of coins required to give that change using U.S. currency denominations (quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies).

### Credit
a program that determines whether a given credit card number is valid or not. The program prompts the user for a credit card number and then uses the Luhn algorithm to check if the number is valid or not. If the number is valid, the program also identifies the issuer of the credit card (e.g., Visa, Mastercard, etc.).

# pset2 - Scrabble, Caesar and Readability 
### Scrabble
in Scrabble, players are presented with a set of letter tiles and a board with certain tile placement restrictions. The goal of the game is to create words on the board using the letter tiles, earning points based on the total point value of the tiles used and any bonus squares on the board.

uses a dictionary file to check whether a word entered by the player is valid. It also assigns point values to each letter based on the Scrabble point system.

### Caesar
a program that encrypts messages using Caesar's cipher. The program prompts the user for a message and a key, and then applies Caesar's cipher to the message using the key to shift the letters in the message by a certain number of positions

### Readability
a program that computes the approximate grade level needed to comprehend a given piece of text. The program prompts the user for a block of text and then uses the Coleman-Liau index to compute the approximate grade level needed to comprehend the text.


# pset3 - Runoff: 
### Runoff
The problem set requires us to implement a program in C that simulates a ranked-choice voting system, also known as an instant runoff election. In this election, each voter can rank the candidates in order of preference, and if no candidate receives a majority of first-place votes, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, and their votes are redistributed to the remaining candidates based on the voter's next preference. This process continues until one candidate has a majority of the votes.

# pset4 - Recover and Filter: 
### Recover
The Recover problem set requires us to implement a program in C that recovers JPEGs from a forensic image file. The program should open a memory card file, read it block by block, and identify the beginning of each JPEG file. The program should then write each JPEG file to a new file, using a consecutive number as the file name.

### Filter
The Filter problem set requires us to implement a program in C that applies image filters to BMP files. The program should take an input BMP file, apply a filter to it, and output the resulting BMP file. The program should support three filters: grayscale, sepia, and reflect. The program should also support the ability to apply multiple filters to an image in sequence.

# pset5 - Speller: 
### Speller
is a program that helps check the spelling of words in a text document against a dictionary of correctly spelled words. The program is designed to use different data structures and algorithms to efficiently spell-check large amounts of text. The program uses a hash table data structure to store the words from the dictionary file and then checks each word in the input text against this hash table.



# pset6 - Readability, DNA, Mario
### Readability
a program that calculates the reading level of a given text using the Coleman-Liau index. The program should take a text file as input, count the number of letters, words, and sentences in the file, and then calculate the index.

### DNA
a program that analyzes a DNA sequence to determine whether it contains a match for a given set of DNA markers. The program should take as input a CSV file containing the DNA markers and a DNA sequence file, and then use the STR (Short Tandem Repeat) algorithm to find matches in the sequence.

### Mario
a program that prompts the user for the height of a pyramid and then prints out a pyramid made of hash symbols (#) with a left-aligned base.

# pset7 - Movies and Fiftyville
SQL based challenges

# pset8 - Homepage
### homepage
a simple homepage made in html, css and javascript

# pset 9 - C$50 Finance
### C$50 Finance
The application allows users to buy and sell stocks, view their transaction history, and check their current balance.


# pset10 - Final Project 
### FitBalance - FitBalance is a fitness tracking web application that allows users to track their daily calorie intake, log their exercises, and monitor their progress towards their fitness goals. This application was built as a final project.
# Conclusion
The CS50 course is an excellent introduction to computer science, covering a wide range of topics and providing practical experience through its problem sets and projects. The submissions in this repository demonstrate my understanding and application of the concepts covered in the course, from programming in C to web development using Flask.
